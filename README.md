# Find A Doc

A front-end web app that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to call and display information from the Better Doctor API

Find A Doc aims to find the best doctor for the user based on their location (city/state), what kind of doctor they're looking for (ie. neurologist, dentist, etc.), and has the option of entering a major complaint they may have. 

Using the https://api.betterdoctor.com/2016-03-01/doctors?query=INSERT_SYMPTOM&specialty_uid=INSERT_SPECIALIZATION&location=INSERT_USER_LOCATION&skip=0&limit=10&user_key=API_KEY end point, I retrieved a list of doctors and displayed their profile images, names, titles, their specilizations, their bios, and phone numbers. The user can then choose the best doctor for them and call to find out more information and maybe even make an appointment.

Plans For Expansion:
* Find doctor location with user zipcode
* Retrieve doctors' email so the user can email the office
* Add user profile so they can favorite and save doctors they are interested in
